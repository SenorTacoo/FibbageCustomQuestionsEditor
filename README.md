# FibbageCustomQuestionsEditor
Have you ever wondered if it's possible to play custom questions in Fibbage? Well, now you can. The Fibbage Custom Questions Editor allows you to create your own set of questions.

If you would like to check how to use this editor, check [this link](https://youtu.be/TY3AOG5B-iw)

Currently working game versions:
- Fibbage XL (individual game)
- Fibbage XL (from Party Pack 1)
- Fibbage 3 (from Party Pack 4)
    - Fibbage enough about you, not supported
    - One question from a "Special" category may appear during the gameplay (to my knowledge, these questions cannot be altered because the game freezes randomly, so I decided to keep the original questions)
- Fibbage 4 (from Party Pack 9)
    - Fibbage enough about you, not supported
    - During the gameplay some "Special" questions may appear (f. ex. Fan questions, VIP questions). For now these questions are kept as is during activating project.
    - Migrating to other versions not supported
